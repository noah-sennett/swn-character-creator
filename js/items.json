They cannot fight or communicate while affected by Hush, but will walk, eat, sit, and perform simple actions as directed by the last person to speak to them. A Hush dose lasts for an hour plus three per Heal level of the person applying the stim, and the subject retains no memories while under the effect. A subject must be immobilized or willing to be affected by Hush; violent physical movement immediately after application disrupts the neurological effects."

This boost speeds natural recovery drastically and heals 1d8 plus the user’s Heal skill in hit points after five minutes of rest. Lift stims do not work on PCs who are mortally wounded; they need to be stabilized before the Lift can help them, though application to a stabilized target will get them back on their feet and active again. Each application adds 1 System Strain to the target. Each additional application of Lift to a target the same day increases the minimum Heal skill needed by 1."

A person affected by Psych immediately gains a Morale score of 12 and a +1 bonus on all skill checks, but will ignore cover during combat and cannot decide not to attempt a skill check after learning its difficulty. The effect lasts fifteen minutes, adds 1 System Strain to the user, and is highly psychologically addictive."

Their reaction speed is much slower as a consequence, and they may act only on even-numbered combat rounds; so on the second, fourth, and sixth rounds and so forth. Any damage they suffer is doubled as well due to their lack of vigilance. Their perfect calm allows them to shoot as if on the target range, however, and they can make Dex/Shoot skill checks to hit a target instead of hit rolls; the difficulty is 7 at point blank, 9 at normal ranges, and 11 at long ranges for the weapon. The target’s Armor Class is ignored. Melee attacks made under Reverie always hit. Reverie lasts for ten minutes and adds 2 System Strain to the target."

Unwilling victims can attempt a Physical saving throw; on a success, they can simply refuse to speak about one particular topic of their choice.

The more time between injury and application, the less chance the patch has to work. Each round after the first, an additional -1 penalty is applied to the skill check. The patch is no use after six rounds. If the medic fails the first skill check, they can keep trying the check once per round until the victim is revived or time runs out.<br><br>Lazarus patches are no use on victims that have died of disease, poison, or have been mangled beyond surgical repair by Heavy weapons or similar trauma.
