Their planet may have survived an all-consuming war, or been deprived of critical materials or energy resources, or simply have been colonized by confirmed Luddites. Other barbarians might be drawn from the impoverished underclass of advanced worlds or the technologically-degenerate inheritors of some high-tech space station or planetary hab.",

Some clergy are conventional priests or priestesses, while others might be cloistered monastics or nuns, or more martial warrior-monks. Modern-day faiths such as Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and other creeds all exist in various sectors, often in altered form, while some worlds have developed entirely new deities or faiths.

Simple prostitution is one form of this background, perhaps as an ordinary streetwalker, a part-time amateur with bills to pay, or an expensive companion to the wealthy, but other forms of satisfaction exist among the many worlds.

Some such rogues are guilty only of crossing some oppressive government or offending a planetary lord, while others have done things that no civilized society could tolerate. Still, their ability to deal with the most desperate and dangerous of contacts and navigate the perils of a less-than-legal adventure can make them attractive associates for a party of freebooters bent on profit and glory more than strict legality.",

The nature of trade varies widely among worlds. On some of them, it’s a business of soberly-dressed men and women ticking off trades on virtual terminals, while on others it is a more... active pursuit, requiring the judicious application of monoblades and deniable gunfire against competitors.

On more primitive worlds, or those with a natural environment that requires close personal attention to crops, a class of peasants will emerge. These men and women often become chattel, part and parcel of the land they occupy and traded among their betters like the farm equipment of richer worlds.
